## ðŸŒ What is this?

**Janitor Writes Accords** is a growing archive of humble proposals and visionary accords â€” written not from the halls of power, but from the heart of humanity.  
It is a symbolic platform where peace, justice, and reconciliation are gently swept into being, scroll by scroll.
