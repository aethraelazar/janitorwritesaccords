    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p><strong>Janitor Writes Accords</strong> is a growing archive of humble proposals and visionary accords — written not from the halls of power, but from the heart of humanity. It is a symbolic platform where peace, justice, and reconciliation are gently swept into being, scroll by scroll.</p>

    <h2>Active Accords</h2>
    <p>
      • <strong>The Trump Accord</strong> — Preserving all forms of life.<br>
      • <strong>The Lula Accord</strong> — Uplifting the forgotten through unity and infrastructure.<br>
      • <strong>The Heavenization Accord</strong> — A world without hunger, homelessness, or despair.<br>
      • <strong>The Korea Accord</strong> — A peaceful path between North & South.<br>
      • <strong>The Accord of Reunited Branches</strong> — Between Israel, Palestine, and Lebanon.<br>
      More accords to come...

    <h2>Temple of Scrolls</h2>
    <p>A future section will house the <strong>Pantheon of Disciplines</strong> — from philosophy, diplomacy, and behavioral science to theology, economics, and poetry. It shall serve as the eternal classroom of the human spirit.</p>
