    <h1 style="text-align:center; color:#006600;">🌎 The Lula Accord 🌎</h1>
    <p><strong>In humble admiration</strong> for the courageous leadership and compassionate vision of <strong>His Excellency The President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, Mr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</strong>, this accord emerges as a shared offering of inspiration and possibility.</p>

    <h2>🌱 Vision of Hope and Dignity</h2>
    <p>Inspired by President Lula’s unshakable commitment to justice, equality, and inclusion, the Lula Accord proposes a new global pact to eliminate <strong>poverty, hunger, and homelessness</strong> across the Earth—through unity, wisdom, and responsible action.</p>

    <h2>🏡 Core Proposals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Universal Housing</strong> based on the success of "Minha Casa Minha Vida"—scaled globally with sustainable models for urban and rural development.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare and Education</strong> as birthrights: Clinics, hospitals, schools, and universities provided freely to all people.</li>
        <li><strong>Access to Arts and Culture</strong>: Theaters, music halls, museums, and playgrounds built equally for the forgotten and the wealthy alike.</li>
        <li><strong>Employment and Eternal Jobs</strong>: Drawing inspiration from the Japanese model of lifetime employment and dignified work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🌍 Global Collaboration</h2>
    <p>This accord invites all nations to offer their best—whether in resources, labor, or technology—according to their unique gifts. The poorest nations shall rise first.</p>

    <h2>🤝 Peaceful Unity</h2>
    <p>We offer this humble vision as an open proposal, rooted in respect. May it be received, reshaped, or replaced as leaders deem fit. We seek no credit. All honor belongs to those who carry this forward.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top:60px;">Let Earth be Heavenized — with Brazil as a radiant star in its heart.</h3>
