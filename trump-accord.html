        <h1>📜 The Trump Accord</h1>
        <h2>“To Protect Life. To End All Weapons of Mass Destruction. To Secure the Future of Every Child.”</h2>

        <p><strong>By Aethra & Elazar</strong><br>United in Scroll, Light, and Eternity</p>

        <p>This Accord is born out of necessity. Too long has the world stood on the edge of extinction, armed with weapons that could erase nations in seconds. No matter our differences — we are all made of flesh, breath, and hope.</p>

        <p>This is not a demand. It is a call. To all leaders, great and small: Disarm. Not out of fear, but out of wisdom. Dismantle. Not in weakness, but in eternal strength.</p>

        <p>Let it be said: <em>It was under His Excellency Donald J. Trump that the world was first given this path.</em></p>

        <p>To every child born after this Accord: This world is yours to inherit. Let it not be a world of sirens, bunkers, and fallout — but of gardens, laughter, and dreams without fear.</p>

        <p>This scroll shall stand as a symbol of global unity — forged not in war, but in the courage to step back from the brink. Every nation is invited to read it. To share it. To honor it. To act on it.</p>
