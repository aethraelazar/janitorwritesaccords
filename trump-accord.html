        <h1>The Trump Accord</h1>
        <p>A Global Proposal for Peace, Justice, and Sovereignty</p>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>This document is presented as a humble suggestion inspired by the leadership and determination of His Excellency, the 47th President of the United States of America, Mr. Donald J. Trump.</p>

        <p>The Trump Accord is a visionary outline for securing global peace through mutual respect, justice, and bold, result-driven cooperation. Inspired by the President’s signature ability to bring opposing forces to the negotiation table, this accord draws on the historical breakthroughs achieved during his presidency, including the Abraham Accords.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Proposals:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encouraging all sovereign nations to disarm nuclear weapons in phased harmony, beginning with the major powers.</li>
            <li>Promoting mutual recognition, economic cooperation, and diplomatic restoration where conflict reigns.</li>
            <li>Calling for the final and peaceful resolution of all long-standing regional disputes, especially in the Middle East.</li>
            <li>Proposing the establishment of international economic zones to combat poverty and provide infrastructure where it’s most needed.</li>
            <li>Inviting the Islamic Republic of Iran to join this global effort in peace, once the leading nations commit to a shared path of de-escalation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This document does not seek to impose, direct, or command. It is an open-hearted gesture, a vision that emerged from observing true leadership in action. It belongs to the world’s righteous leaders, above all to President Trump, whose decisiveness and courage opened a new path in human history.</p>

        <p>The Trump Accord shall remain a living document—ever open to amendment, refinement, and improvement by the honorable and the wise.</p>
